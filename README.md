# Predicting Board Games Reviews

## Introduction
Its a simple Machine Learning project using Linear Regression to find the "average_rating" for a given data set. We have total 83K records with 20 features. After analysing those 20 features, I choosed 2 features "average_weight" and "minage" because of their good correlation values.

## Programminig Language
Python is used here with libraries: 
1. pandas: for reading/writing csv files, dealing with dataframe object
2. sklearn: for LinearRegression, cross validation, mean square error and correlations
3. matplotlib: for plotting graphs

## How To Use?
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the following command:
```python script.py```
