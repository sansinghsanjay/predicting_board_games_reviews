Synopsis

Its a simple Machine Learning project using Linear Regression to find the "average_rating" for a given data set. We have total 83K records with 20 features. After analysing those 20 features, I choosed 2 features "average_weight" and "minage" because of their good correlation values.

Code Example

This is Python code using libraries: Pandas (for reading/writing csv files, dealing with dataframe object), sklearn (for LinearRegression, cross validation, mean square error and correlations), matplotlib (for plotting graphs).code is short and concise.

Installation

Developed program is tested with Python 2.7.

Tests
